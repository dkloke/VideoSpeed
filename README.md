This extension looks for <strong>all</strong> <span class="hilite">&lt;video&gt;</span> elements on the page, and adjusts their playback speed (<span class="hilite">.playbackRate</span>) simultaneously for all tags on the page.
            <br /><br />
            Adjust video playback rate using <span class="keys">&uarr;</span>/<span class="keys">&darr;</span> cursor keys, a mouse/touch interface, or manual entry.
            <br /><br />
            The app does not send any information to the developer, and only stores user preferences locally. VideoSpeed makes no effort to be compatible with on-page code or other browser apps.
            <br /><br />
            Repeated speed adjustments can cause video players to lose audio synchronization. To recover audio sync, try skipping forward/back or adjusting the video's replay position, stop and restart the player, or reload the page.
